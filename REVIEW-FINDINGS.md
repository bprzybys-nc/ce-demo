## CRITICAL ISSUES ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Success Rate Statistics NOT From Source Material

**Location:** All three documents
**Issue:** The presentation claims specific success rates that are NOT in the source material:
- Vibe Coding: 10%
- Prompt Engineering: 40%
- Context Engineering: 90%+

**Source Material:** The original repository emphasizes Context Engineering is "10x better than prompt engineering and 100x better than vibe coding" but does NOT provide specific percentage success rates.

**Recommendation:** Either:
- Remove the specific percentages and use qualitative descriptions
- Add disclaimer that these are illustrative estimates
- Replace with the original "10x/100x better" language

**Risk:** Could be seen as making unsupported claims about effectiveness.

---

### 2. Time Claim in Example

**Location:** Slide 8 (Presentation)
**Issue:** "Feature complete in 8 minutes" - this specific timing was NOT in the source material.

**Recommendation:** Either:
- Change to "Feature complete quickly" or "in minutes"
- Add qualifier like "~8 minutes (example timing)"
- Remove specific timing

---

## MODERATE ISSUES ‚öôÔ∏è

### 3. Color Descriptions Don't Match Updated Palette

**Location:** Presenter script (Slide 3, lines 78-82)
**Issue:** Script references "dark blue," "bright blue," "green," "red" but colors have been updated to Tailwind palette.

**Current in presentation:**
- Dark Gray (#1F2937) - described as "dark blue"
- Blue (#3B82F6) - correct
- Green (#10B981) - correct
- Pink (#EC4899) - described as "red"

**Recommendation:** Update presenter script color descriptions:
- "Dark gray (CLAUDE.md) - Your project's constitution"
- "Pink (examples/) - What good looks like"

---

### 4. Tutorial Mermaid Diagram Uses Old Colors

**Location:** ce-hands-on-tutorial.md (line 65-82)
**Issue:** Tutorial has Mermaid diagram with old color palette (#E74C3C, #27AE60) instead of Tailwind colors.

**Recommendation:** Update tutorial diagram to match presentation palette for consistency.

---

### 5. Claude Code Command Verification

**Location:** Tutorial Part 2.2 (lines 198-212)
**Issue:** Commands `claude --version` and `claude .` may not be accurate. Claude Code might use different commands.

**Recommendation:** Verify actual Claude Code CLI commands or change to:
```bash
# Open Claude Code and navigate to the project directory
# Verify Claude Code is installed and running
```

---

### 6. /help Command Reference

**Location:** Tutorial Checkpoint 2 (line 534)
**Issue:** "Run `/help` in Claude Code" - need to verify this is accurate command.

**Recommendation:** Verify slash command syntax in Claude Code or soften language to "explore available commands."

---

## MINOR ISSUES üîß

### 7. Repository Stars Reference

**Location:** Not included but was in source material
**Info:** Source mentioned "approximately 11.2k stars" - could add credibility if included.

**Recommendation:** Optional - could add to resources section.

---

### 8. Markdown Linting Issues

**Location:** ce-demo-presentation.md
**Issues:**
- Line 12: MD040 - fenced code block without language
- Line 71: MD036 - emphasis used instead of heading
- Line 111: MD040 - fenced code block without language

**Recommendation:** Add language identifiers to code blocks for consistency.

---

### 9. Incomplete INITIAL.md Section Names

**Location:** Slide 5 (line 176-186)
**Issue:** Shows "1. FEATURE, 2. EXAMPLES, 3. DOCUMENTATION, 4. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS"

Source material shows these without numbers - just as section headers.

**Recommendation:** Minor - current version is actually clearer for presentation purposes. Keep as is.

---

## ACCURACY VERIFICATION ‚úÖ

### Correct Information Verified:

1. **‚úÖ Four Core Components:** CLAUDE.md, INITIAL.md, PRPs/, examples/ - ACCURATE
2. **‚úÖ File Structure:** All paths and directory structure match source
3. **‚úÖ Four Sections of INITIAL.md:** FEATURE, EXAMPLES, DOCUMENTATION, OTHER CONSIDERATIONS - ACCURATE
4. **‚úÖ Workflow Steps:**
   - Write INITIAL.md
   - Run /generate-prp
   - Run /execute-prp
   - Validation loops
   - ACCURATE

5. **‚úÖ Five Best Practices:**
   - Be Explicit
   - Provide Examples
   - Use Validation
   - Link Documentation
   - Customize CLAUDE.md
   - ACCURATE to source "Five Core Best Practices"

6. **‚úÖ Key Quote:** "Most agent failures aren't model failures‚Äîthey're context failures" - ACCURATE

7. **‚úÖ Repository URL:** github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro - ACCURATE

8. **‚úÖ Philosophy:** "Context Engineering is 10x better than prompt engineering and 100x better than vibe coding" - ACCURATE

---

## CONSISTENCY CHECK üìã

### Cross-Document Consistency:

1. **‚úÖ Terminology:** Consistent use of terms (PRP, INITIAL.md, CLAUDE.md) across all docs
2. **‚úÖ Component Count:** All reference "Four Core Components" consistently
3. **‚úÖ Workflow Steps:** Consistent 4-step workflow across all documents
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è Success Rates:** Consistently wrong - all three docs use unsupported percentages

## RECOMMENDATIONS PRIORITY

### Must Fix (Before Presentation):

1. **Remove or qualify success rate percentages** (10%, 40%, 90%+)
   - Option A: Remove percentages, use "low/medium/high success"
   - Option B: Add footnote "Illustrative estimates based on methodology"
   - Option C: Use source quote "10x better... 100x better"

2. **Update presenter script color descriptions** to match Tailwind palette

3. **Soften or remove "8 minutes" timing** claim

### Should Fix (Quality Improvement):

4. Update tutorial Mermaid diagram colors to Tailwind palette
5. Verify Claude Code CLI commands or use generic instructions
6. Fix markdown linting issues (add language tags to code blocks)

### Nice to Have:

7. Add repository star count for credibility
8. Add more specific examples from actual repository if available
